This is the Ultimate Crypto App to track hottest Crypto coins and token Price, Market Cap and News.

Its been over an year for me watching, tracking and investing in the Cryto Market. Few of my favorite Crypto Research tools have been **CoinMarketCap** and **CoinGecko**. These are the websites with information of thousands of Cryptocurrencies like Current Price, Market Cap, Total Supply, Circulating Supply, 24h/1d/7d/30d... charts, offical website, Whitepaper link, etc. Since I needed to practice ReactJs and working with APIs, I thought it would be cool to build a Crypto Market tracker of my own. So, here it is.

> Tech used to build this project is ReactJs, ant.design, Redux, chart.js and Coinranking & Bing News Search API by RapidAPI.
